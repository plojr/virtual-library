It’s a very simple web application, like www.skoob.com.br, where you can add the basic information (the number of pages and the date you finish reading the book) about the books you’ve already read and/or you want to.

After that, you'll be able to have some statistics like:
- how many pages you read in a specific month/year;
- how many books you read;
- the pace you're reading;
- etc.
